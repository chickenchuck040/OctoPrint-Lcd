# OctoPrint-Lcd
An octoprint plugin for using a Pi display with Octoprint

It uses Kivy to draw graphics and receive touch events, so it should work anywhere Kivy is supported, and an Octoprint instance is running, including Android. This is an Octoprint plugin to that it can hook directly into Octoprint's internal modules without having to bombard Octoprint with constant HTTP requests to update the status, making it very slow.
